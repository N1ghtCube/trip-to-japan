                <h3>Riga <-> Tokyo</h3>
                <p>
                    Let's start of with how we got in Japan. The most obvious way was by the airplane. But we weren't pleased with the cost of 2 two way tickets 
                    being around 2000 euros, so I monitored the price for June since October in Google Flights. During the November we saw the price drop to 1500 
                    but we decided to wait longer. Then I read that usually prices drop in the period of 1-3 months before the actual flight and so I relaxed a bit. 
                    Finally, during the March I managed to notice tickets for 1300 and phoned my dad to but them. Since we had the budget of 1500 euros for transportation 
                    to Japan we decided to book places with big leg space. It helped to be relaxed during the flight, but wasn't enough to sleep. We also looked for flights 
                    which weren't long in terms of duration. And these tickets were perfect since it took only 20 hours overall to get from Riga to Tokyo. 
                </p>

                <h3>JR pass</h3>
                <p>
                    Hours before our flight dad decided to buy Japan Rail pass. It was because our overall costs according to my calculations were a little smaller 
                    than the pass. However, with it we wouldn't be nervous buying the wrong ticket or being late for train and it even saved time since we intended to use 
                    buses for traveling from one city to another, but now we could use shinkansen. Luckily, we managed to but it before Japan made it more expensive. This 
                    pass has to be collected in Japan, and one MUST NOT loose it since there is no way to print a new one, then it can be used as a ticket for all Japan 
                    Rails(you can check what are those on the official website).

                <h3>Tokyo</h3>
                <p>
                    For transportation in Tokyo we bought 2-day metro pass. Again, if we haven't bought it we would spend around the same price for tickets, but first, we 
                    were free to go anywhere, and second, we didn't have to buy a ticket every time for a new ride. We bought it only for 2 days even though they had for 3 
                    days also and we spent there that amount of time so it would be logical, but during the first day we haven't done much and mostly just wandered in 
                    Akihabara. For all our travelling we used Google Maps in order to find the fastest route and there was absolutely no problems with it. Even though it 
                    might be hard for foreigner to understand this tool shows which station to look for, what gate, what side and most of the time there are multiple options 
                    how to get somewhere.
                </p>

                <h3>Tokyo -> Kawaguchiko</h3>
                <p>
                    There weren't any direct routed for this trip so we first had to go to Shinjuku, since it provided a lot of options. There we sat on Express train, however, 
                    you must know, that they are reservation-only. Even though JR pass allows to book them for free you still have to do it. It is done on the website, where 
                    you choose route(starting points and destination), time, and sits(you can either choose them specifically or sit on any where on top of them are red lights). 
                    Then, we transfered to a local train in Outski and we had to buy a ticket through the person, so we had to wait in line for a bit and explain where we want to get. 
                    There I also asked for the first collectable card because japanese really like train thematic so you can ask conducter for one and this card would have a 
                    picture of the train you were riding.

                    Even though there was some transport in that city, we haven't used it since it wouldn't really help, our destinations were nowhere near the stations. 
                    That is why we only walked there for an entire day.

                    There were no direct options to get from Kawaguchiko to Kyoto, so the easiest way was to go to Tokyo first by the same route we took previously, and 
                    then took a shinkansen. In order to do so we had to ask special workers to print us one by providing our JR pass and saying our destination. They also 
                    asked what seats we want and having window one next to each other was no problem.

                <p>
                    In Kyoto we finally made our Suica card, however there it was called Icoca. That allowed us to freely use it instead of buying tickets every now and then, 
                    since we haven't bought any passes and wanted to save time. Here we used both metro and buses. All of it was pretty cheap and we spent around 2.5 euros 
                    to get from one place to another. In buses you have to attach the card to the terminal as you enter orpay as you leave(at least that's what we've 
                    done).

                    In Kobe we only used trains and at first we were a little confused since there were a lot of train lines on one station and we sat on the wrong train,
                    express one, that is why we passed our station and had to go back. In order to get to the Nunobiki gardens we used cabins and the same route was near 
                    it but it could took us to the top of the mountain, however, during that day they were already closed.

                    In Nagoya we used only 2 trains, but we needed to travel a lot of stations so it took a long time. We also didn't understand why we didn't need to show 
                    ticket at the start but when we got off the train we had to pass the gates and that is where we paid, they asked from which station we got on and the 
                    price differed.
