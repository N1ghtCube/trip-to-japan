            <h3>Tonkatsu</h3>
            <p>
                This dish consists of a pork covered with bread pieces deep-fried. In our case we cooked it ourselves on stone and had a lot of side-dishes as 
                well. Most of the stuff came into the rice and sauces were used for meat. It was a nice, light meal with nothing extra-ordinary. Nothing stood out 
                so it was pleasant to eat, and portion was super large so I couldn't finish it. We also tried our first miso soup there which was supposed to be drunk 
                by itself, and it was like bouillon with seaweed.
            </p>

            <p>
                We ordered bowl of rice and sashimi, and this fish was for sure fresh and tasty. My favourite was tuna since it didn't have any unpleasant taste 
                at all. 
            </p>

            <p>
                We went into Kura Sushi which is not a fancy restaurant but sushi there were good and we had no complaints about it. They didn't have as rich flavout as 
                sashimi, but we just wanted to eat so it was alright.
            </p>

            <h3>Udon</h3>
            <p>
                This was the first time we tried a dish with such richness of flavour. Noodles were a bit too big to normally eat but they didn't loose their structure 
                and were nice to consume. The meat was of a horse and I understood that I am not a big fan of it. Again, portion was very big.

            <h3>Karaage</h3>
            <p>
                I got myself a bouillon with karaage which is deep-fried chiken and when I added it together I understood my mistake, because it quickly got soaky and 
                wasn't really getting good together. But I still enjoyed the meal and again I got a lot of food.
            </p>

            <p>
                The bouillon was as rich as in udon, and I prefered more these noodles. I didn't quite like menma(marinated bamboo), but meat was good and all in all I 
                enjoyed it.

                Here I for the first time tried crab and it wasn't really much of a delicacy and since it's not cheap I probably will never eat it.

            <h3>Curry</h3>
            <p>
                This dish was quite spicy, without rice it would be problematic to eat but still had a great taste. We had a choice of not adding chicken but it for sure 
                tasted better with it.

            <h3>Wagyuu</h3>
            <p>
                In my opinion, everyone should try this at least once. It was nothing like any previous beef I ate before. And even though we paid ~5 euro per each slice 
                of meat it was totally worth it. I for the fist time experienced meat melting in my mouth. We coocked it ourselves, so I guess if professionals did it, it 
                would be even better.

                That was a pretty bitter tea and most of the time it was served in small portions. It is similar if you leave a bag of green tea stay for a long time in your cup.

                I honestly expected it to have more of the taste even though it's mostly rice, but still it was a nice sweet.

            <h3>Oolong tea</h3>

                That is the most unusual stuff we tried there, because it tastes like some volcanic water so we drank it only in restaurants where it was served for 
                free.

                I haven't tasted any alcohol before so I can just say that it didn't have any taste and only unpleasant feeling of alcohol could be felt.

                In half of our hotels we had a buffet where we could choose our food and it was alright, some of it resembled european culture some of it japanese, and 
                the only thing I can say is that they surely have troubles with fruits and a bit with meat, that is why it's hard to find it there.

            <h3>Convenience food</h3>
            <p>
                In convenience stores you can find prepared food and unlike other contries it actually is fresh and tastes good, so for most of our dinners we would have 
                that as our meal(we had lunches late and they were big).

                That thing is the most advanced there, since not only do they have a huge range of things you can buy from there, food also can come in different 
                temperatures, that is why you can have a cold icecream or a drink, or hot tea and sandwich.
