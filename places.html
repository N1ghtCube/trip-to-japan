                        <p>
                            It is a multiple story mall with a huge diversity of goods in there. You can probably find there anything starting from the smart toilet seats and 
                            ending with expensive watches, and that was probably located on the same floor. Everything is bright and clean, it's hard to focus on 1 thing and you 
                            just keep finding new interesting staff. That was a nice place to visit at first, because it shortly described how Japan really is.

                        <p>
                            I won't list all of the manga stores we visited during that day because it was more than 10 for sure and they were pretty much the same. It's just the same 
                            book store we have in our country but instead of books there is manga. Different genres, different categories, all kinds of stories. There is pretty much 
                            equal amount of anime themed accessories so you can find practicly anything there. Most of them are taking multiple floors in buildings and some have 18+ 
                            category located on the last one with DVDs, manga and others, but unfortunately, they didn't have those which are popular overseas or at least I couldn't 
                            find them.

                        <p>
                            This restaurant was located underground and when we got there, there was no line so we sat and ate our food. It was really good, an air there was quite hot 
                            because of no windows but I felt high quality there and from this place I discovered that food at restaruants costs way lower than I expected and portions were 
                            enourmous, so everyday we had a lunch in a restaurant.

                        <p>
                            We didn't plan to visit this temple, but on our way to Tokyo Tower we just couldn't help when we noticed a quizzy roof to go check it out. This is a 
                            conference hall and luckily nothing happened during our visit so we peacefully observed it, it took less than 10 minutes so if you pass it you might as well 
                            check it.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Tokyo Tower</h4>
                        <p>
                            When I say this building was massive I really mean it. Again, I planned to just witness it from a short distance, but my dad decided to just go there and 
                            buy tickets for 30 euro for both of us. And honestly, it was worth it and I am glad he did it. We were given an audio-guide where we could select a language 
                            and then hear about the history of this tower. On the half way to the top we stopped on a floor where we were photographed. On the peak we could set a 
                            direction we were looking on and the guide would explain what is located there. It was said that it's possible to see Mt.Fuji from there but it's very unlikely.
                            There is also a bathroom on the top so that helped a lot. On the way back you can actually take stairs and go all the way down by feet. We did so and wouldn't 
                            really do it again. Down below there was a big souvenier shop where we could get our photo printed for free in a newspaper page, or pay 10 euro and get it printed 
                            in a bigger size.

                            We didn't really explored it that much so we just passed through it till we got to our next destiantion. But on our way we found Hokora which is a tine Gods house 
                            and a snake which really surprised me.

                        <p>
                            We walked through the cemetery, and unlike ours, it looked very decent and clean, there were plenty of brushes and large spoons that you could use to clean the grave. 
                            We then entered Zojo-ji and there we discovered for the first time that each prayer consists of throwing coins into a special box. and witnessed Buddha statues. 
                            It was completely indistinguishable from the pictures, and the atmosphere of a church reigned inside. The other buildings were not so remarkable. The gates were told 
                            to be the only structure which was not reconcstructed and they were really big and beautiful.

                            This place was located near the Zojo-ji and we got our tickets from a woman next to the entrance for 300 yen and there were just some statues so I can't 
                            say that much. I wasn't really impressed but for 300 yen we didn't waste much.

                            I had this in my plan but only as optional thing because it was seasonal but I didn't check if it would be open when we got there, but due to huge luck we 
                            decided to go there and that was really a waste of 30 euro. There were lots of installations with fish but nothing special, there are far better things to 
                            spend these 30 euro so keep then for later.

                            We didn't go to auction because it is practically impossible to get there. If you want to go for the free one you have to get there at 3 or 4 am because only 
                            around 30 people are allowed to be there watching so we just went to eat there.

                            We went there because it looked local and even though it wasn't as prestige as previous restaurant food was still good and no problems occurred. We ordered 
                            sashimi with rice and it was lit, fish was fresh and extremely tasty, I really liked it and I got my belly full.

                            There were a lot of people in kimono and even some school trip happened there, it was a cool festival atmosphere and Senso-ji wasn't the only cool building there. 
                            There even was a small nature area with greenness and we could chill there. All in all, really cool.

                            We bought evening tickets the same day we went there so we could enjoy night city and compare to Tokyo Tower. There were 2 floors - 350th and 450th. I honestly 
                            recommend to take all the pictures on the 350th one because even though there are less people on 450th the lighting there just ruins everything. The view was 
                            astonishing and the lights went till the horizen.It was an amazing experience and I would totally visit it again and put it the first in my list.

                            We saw there turtle and stayed under a roof for a little while the rain was going.

                        <p>
                            In order to get better understanding of swordsmithing we visited this museum and it fulfilled our desires. We were given a booklet which described parts of 
                            katana, different types and with that knowledge I analyzed provided swords in a room. There alse were books which contained prints of katanas to remake them 
                            in the future. I really enjoyed it, since I could actually distinguish different temeprings, while my dad haven't done preparations and went straight for the 
                            swords and had nothing to do for the rest of the time.

                            That was the best garden we've ever visited. Among all buildings there was a small park with a little pond with fish and turteles in it. Everything was 
                            super clean with no trash lying around. It was very peaceful there and really great for relaxation. Totally recommend.

                            way to Sword museum, but it was nothing special.

                            Unluckily, we visited it the time when half of it was under reconstruction. But neverminding that there was still enough of paintings to see. I don't usually 
                            enjoy art but that interested even me. I liked the style and there also were some manga made by him, for exmaple soldiers dancing and it was quite impressive 
                            how he could show all the motions, so pretty alright.

                            In this zoo for relatively cheap price we could explore a whole new animals we'd never seen before in real life. There was a huge line for pandas and an old 
                            man stood there with a paper which said that we would wait around 25 minutes and he was correct. Sadly there was only 1 small panda and we could see it for 1-2 
                            minutes only. But as we went further we saw that there was a big panda near there but we had to make a loop around others animals. On the way there there were 
                            also red pandas and they were kind of cute. As we approached the big panda it quickly turned around and started eating bamboo and for at least 10 minutes it 
                            contidued to do it so we left. We then checked Small Mammal House and Vivarium, both of them included animals we haven't seen before, so it was a nice experience. 
                            One more highlight was gorillas. They had a really big area just for them and ranged from a little baby till an old gorilla father. We were hungry by that time 
                            so we couldn't check all animals so there is much more to explore.

                            This restaurant provides and interesting experience of eating. We first self checked-in and went to our table. By opening the lid in it you can get yourself 
                            sauces, green tea powder, marinated ginger and chopsticks. There is also a dispenser of boiling water for the tea and cups above the seats. 
                            Next to the table is constantly moving conveyor with plates. They have sushi in it and you just pick 
                            those you liked. After eating you drop the plates in a specail hole and machine counts your total bill based on that. You can also order special meal on tablet 
                            and it will be delivered on second conveyor above the previous one. For every 5th plate there is a game where you can win a gacha ball, it requires no interactions 
                            so it's complete luck. Sushi weren't something special but I can't complain about anything.

                            When I saw the pictures of it I thought it was probalby only on busy days, but I quickly realised my mistake when even on the way to Shibuya a whole 
                            train was completely fulled with people. As we left the station there was massive crowd. I guess this crossing is worth visiting for 2 reasons:
                            amount of people and buildings with big billboards on them, esspecially in the night it looks amazing.

                            it was definetly worth every penny. It was so far different from the regular beef we ate, and it literally melter in our mouths. Everyone should try this at

                            This bar could be seen in a film "Lost in Translation", and that was the reason my dad wanted to go there. It was a huge building with lots of floors. After 
                            a few minutes investingating we understood how to get to it. First, you have to enter the first elevator and get to about 43th floor and then switch to the 
                            second one and get to the top. After getting to the 43th floor we realised that there is another sort of bar here but it was already closed. Instead of walls 
                            there were big windows which were covered with curtains, so we moved them a little and got an astonishing view on city. We made some photos and tried to go 
                            to bar, but we were asked to go back because of dresscode. So for free you can actually visit the first bar and peacefully view a night Tokyo.

                            The best way to understand and enjoy different culture is to visit its local places and this restaurant is one of them. Here we ordered  two udon 
                            bowls which came with rich boullion, vegetables and horse meat. The restaurant itself wasn't that big but at the same time quite spacious. There 
                            weren't lots of people so we quietly enjoyed our meal as we were sitting on the floor, the way it was suppoused to be always. Definetly should visit one 
                            of those on the trip there because it doesn't come close to any other chain restaurants.

                            a Mt.Fuji, but only in rare ocassions it can be actually made since most of the time there are a lot of clouds and that day there was even a mist. There is 
                            also a possibility of meeting boars, bears or even monkeys. You can actually go a bit higher and sit there under a roof and enjoy the view if you got one.

                            After a long and a tiring day nothings beats the bath in a natural hot springs. That is exactly why we spent about an hour just to get there and it was 
                            the greatest choice we could make. As you walk in you first unshoe yourself and put the boots in a cell. Then you ask a cashier to go inside 
                            and she will provide 2 towels, one for drying and the smaller for putting it on the head while bathing. Next step is to go to the locker room and 
                            undress. Put clothes in a locker and keep the key. Then enter the room with baths. Firstly, wash yourself in a shower(it is done sitting), they provide all 
                            sorts of washing liquids so no worries here. And only now you can enter baths. There were all sorts of those: regular, carbonated, jacuzzi, cold, with sunbeds 
                            and of corse mineral one. The hot spring was located on the street and the walls of it were made out of big rocks and there was literally salt and I guess 
                            other minerals on them so it was no ordinary water for sure. They also had sunbeds outside the pool to cool down after it as the water was 40 degrees Celcium. 
                            They also had a sauna which was 90-100 degrees and before entering there you have to grab another towel which you would place under yourself since you are fully 
                            naked and there is no need to leave behind unwanted body fluids. As you finish bathing you go back to the locker room and dry yourself up. Even in the mans changing 
                            room there were all sorts of hygiene things to use. When leaving you have to pay in a machine for your visit and you are free to go.

                            objects getting in a way and it for sure looked amazing. I have never seen something so big and nature made since in Latvia it is mainly plains so it was 
                            an unordinary experience which I highly enjoyed.

                            Unfortunately, there was no English translation, but basically that is a karaage(deep-fried chicken) restaurant. It was nothing special but one thing 
                            that I noticed was that in most of these places there is a water dispenser for free to use, so less interactions with people needed. The food was good, 
                            but I made a mistake when I added chicken to the soup and it got swollen. All in all it was alright.

                            On the way to the next destination I noticed this shrine. It was a really small one and it got anime posters on which caught my attention. Besides from that 
                            it had nothing else to offer.

                            I haven't noticed much of the difference here from other cinemas, but you could buy the ticket yourself from the machine and there were a lot of toys and 
                            accessories you could buy based on the films showed at that time.

                            This is another anime shop, on the first floor there were mangas(some with erotic content but not 18+), clothes and accessories. On the forth there was an 
                            adult section with huge variety of manga and DVDs, it also included real content. On the third, however, there was a sex shop with again all sorts of things 
                            and even those I haven't seen before. I guess anyone could find there something what would suit them and one of the highlights was  an artifitial female 
                            genitalia which was supposed to be a representation of one made-up character.

                            This temple was the first one we visited in Kyoto and there we discovered that those aren't the only thing to look at and you can walk around a whole park there. 
                            Near the entrance there was a huge bell and you could actually ring it. For 200 yen you get the ability to hit it with the special wooden column and anyone in the 
                            area would hear it. They also give a postcard as a souvenier for it. The temple itself was pretty good, it had a nice location near the pond and everything was very 
                            clean, so our guess is that money spent on a ticket goes to cleaning the whole area. We could not enter the temple but it was still enough to satisfy us.

                            It was located in a huge park and there also was a pond. We had to go quite far to get to the temple and on the way there there were some buildings for personal and 
                            some statues. Here you could enter the temple and there was the famous stone garden. It wasn't overall that good but the location and price allow to still visit it.

                            This is exatcly the type of museums I always wanted to visit. Unlike many others where it's just some artifacts and plain facts from history this place provided 
                            interactive games to better understand how things work and developed. You could enter any train and check the insides, see how wheels for them were designed, switch 
                            railways, become a worker who fixes problems on the road(digitally), try an uniform, see the whole movie with small real trains going around the model city and many 
                            other things. This place had a lot of kids in it, but it didn't ruin the experience as only some of them were crying and screaming.

                            In this place we saw many sea animals we hadn't even known about. It started with some gray long stone-like fish, after that there was a cafe with seals swimming 
                            next to it. Then there was an amazing big aquarium with all sorts of fishes there. First you saw it through a samll window and as you went down there was a big glass 
                            panel which allowed to see all parts of it. Some sofas allowed to watch it for quite a time and most people gathered there. Then we went to the second floor which was 
                            mainly occcupied with jellyfish. There were different kinds with some installations and even how they breed them. Then followed some small aquariums with 
                            unusual fishes(mainly 1 or 2 for each aquarium). On the third floor in the open air there was a large pool with 2 dolphins, but sadly, we weren't on time for their 
                            performance. As we moved to the exit there was a small garden with rice field and a river.

                            by a moat. There also was a pond with fish and multiple buildings. The castle itself was made for shogun to meet his guests. There also were "singing" floors which 
                            we mistook for just poor structuring. And on the corner of this land there was a hill where one can view all castle.

                            praying so loud you could hear it on the street. Some of the buildings were reconstructed, but there was still a lot to see. We went even further and higher and there 
                            was a small room with open walls and quizzy musical instrument for praying. There also was a huge bell.

                            pay(even though we knew, just had forgotten).

                            Honestly, after seeing so many temples I no longer found it interesting seeing new ones, and this one costed higher than others, so if you are still willing to see 
                            a nice temple with a pond near the hills and forest than help yourself.

                        <p>
                            Due to the high amount of tourists going there bamboo is really worn off, but it still creates a nice picture of tall grass just surrounding you because 
                            we've never been to something like that before but that was pretty much it. It mostly served as a route from one place to another.

                            In order to enter this garden we had to pay but it was totally worth it. First we got to a house where we got served macha with some chulk-like candy. 
                            We then followed tha pathway and got to the next house. There was an area full of moss but it actually looked great becuase there was no trash or leafes 
                            lying there. As we moved further we could see a little house on the next side of the river on a hill. Then there was a small viewpoint of Kyoto. And closer 
                            to the end there was a house where you could write whatever you want in a notebook. We really liked it and were glad to go there, because we haven't planned it.

                            There wasn't anything particularly interesting there so we just passed through it in order to get to the next place but there was a very large river 
                            and some people were on boats where person used stick to  push off the ground and go faster.

                            The park itself was located on top of the hill so we first paid for the tickets and then climbed all the way to the top. As we were walking there were 2 fans 
                            which sprayed water and it was so genious and helpful I can't describe. There also were so questions you could try to ask and then see the answers about the 
                            monkeys and as we approached the top the voice explained us how to behave near them. Firstly, there was a cooling room where you could relax because that day 
                            it was extremely hot, there also was a feeding room in which you could enter and feed monkeys but we decided not to, and of course from such high you can see 
                            all Kyoto. Amount of monkeys was way more than I expected and they were also quite close to people. I was satisfied with this place and got down with a smile.

                            Here we could see and even touch different types of owls. The room wasn't that big, but still there were quite a lot of owls. The were cuffed to branches 
                            and couldn't fly off but they didn't try that. Some of them were labeled "I am new here" and "I am not in a mood", so you couldn't pet those ones. They had 
                            a really soft feathers and after petting some I was no more that scared of them. All in all, interesting experience.

                            ones. They weren't as clean as on pictures and there were a lot of people. We just kept going higher and nothing changed. After 30 minutes I stayed on the 
                            checkpoint as my dad continued. I could again see Kyoto from there and there was a sunset creating a nice view. My dad returned and said that nothing was 
                            there, so we went back.

                            This free museum provided an opportunity to find out how sake is being made and its history particularly in Kobe. There were multiple checkpoints with

                            I really was part of this process. There also was a theatre with a 20-30 minute film about this companies history and unlike other company films it was 
                            actually fascinating. At the end there were souveniers and lots of sake types. You could try 3 of them from a dispenser and another machine dispensed for 
                            a few yen. That made us buy 4 bottles and then carry them all day.

                            Singapore. We first were shown a film of the earthquake in 1995 and its consequences. We then understood that there mostly worked really old people as 
                            volunteers. They looked really excited when they saw some tourists and esspecially ones which speak japanese. We were shown where, how, how often, why 
                            earthquakes happpen and even how structures are nowadays built to resist those. There also were some interactive games to play and I honestly liked it.

                            We could see whole Kobe from it as well as Nunobiki Waterfall and a dam. On top there was a building with cafe and a room where you could smell 
                            different scents; if you wanted, you could take a piece of paper of the scent you liked and buy it at the souvenir shop when you leave. You can go down

                            go along this river and there was another not as magnificent waterfall but still good-looking. The sound of stream was relaxing and I really like this
