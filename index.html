                                On the first day we had a flight from Latvia to Denmark at 7:55. We got up at 5 o'clock,
                                had
                                a breakfast and went to the airport.
                                During the check-in lady asked if we had filled the form about entering Japan. I started
                                stressing because after all research I've done
                                I hadn't heard a thing about it before. She wrote down the website where we could fill
                                this
                                form and as we were waiting for the plane,
                                I registred us and hoped everything would be alright.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                When we landed in Denmark I asked staff about it, but they had no idea. The period
                                between
                                flights was 4 hours, so we waited on comfy chairs,
                                and then moved closer to our gate. For all this time I watched the Ricky Gervais show so
                                the
                                time went fast.

                                on

                                We had the first seats in our class, so there was enough leg space, and there also sat
                                stuart, who was an incredibly kind old man,
                                we asked him some questions concerning Japan, and exactly because of him I got the
                                answer
                                about the entrance form. Turned out
                                we haven't filled it completely, so we had to complete it on place with pen.
                            </p>

                                The flight itself was very long(~13 hours), we had 2 meals: dinner and breakfast. They
                                tasted okay, but I learned that during the flight
                                all food seems tasteless due to abnormal conditions. We also had a tablet with an access
                                to
                                some films, music and games. You can even
                                purchase internet there, so if you haven't prepared for long boredom that's a great
                                solution.

                                But the most important thing was that even with legspace, it was extremely difficult to
                                have
                                some sleep. So I highly recommend to choose a flight
                                which would arrive at your destination at evening, that way you can get a nice rest.

                                We finally arrived at 7 in the morning in Haneda airport. It was all cloudy and there
                                was a
                                huge mist around the airport
                                so we couldn't catch a glance at Tokyo. We got out of the airplane and moved to where
                                everyone else were. First thing I noticed was that
                                there were lots of workers, some of them just stood to show directions. They told us to
                                move
                                near ATM like machines. One person showed where to go,
                                another pointed out which machine to approach, and for every machine there was a
                                personal
                                helper. These machines checked passport
                                and put our fingerprints and faces in database. Next we filled the form, and passed
                                passport-control, got the luggage and finally,
                                we were officially in Japan.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="blocks" id="block_2">
                            <p>
                                I had a concrete plan of things we had to do. It went like this:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Exchange currency</li>
                                <li>Buy Wi-Fi SIM card</li>
                                <li>Collect JR pass</li>
                                <li>Purchase Tokyo Metro 2 day pass</li>
                                <li>Get Suica card</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div class="blocks" id="block_3">
                            <p>
                                We checked store with Wi-Fi opportunities, the price was around 40 EUR for 15 days, we
                                kept
                                that in mind and moved on to exchange our money to yen.
                                The rate was okay so we had no problem with it.
                                Then we got our JR pass, and lady kindly explained how it works(even though she wasn't
                                fluent in English, she had a paper with instructions).
                                Next we purchased the metro pass and got back to the store from the beginning,
                                because we couldn't find better options. On they way out to Tokyo Monorail line, there
                                were
                                ticket machines with Suica image on top of them.
                                With hope to buy it there we approached it, but turned out, they were out of them for
                                some
                                reason. Maybe it has something to do with the fact
                                that it was Monday. Anyway, we set to English language and purchased train ticket by
                                choosing our destination and inserting yen in it. For the whole trip we used
                                Google Maps in order to find route for destination and it brilliantly completed its
                                work.

                                The first ride and the first sight of Japan were outstanding, marvelous. The whole car
                                was
                                filled with Japanese people, completely different culture.
                                The buildings around looked like they were built a year or two ago, they were clean and
                                with
                                no defects, so tall and close to each other.
                                But roads weren't full with cars and people like one can imagine.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                We arrived at the station and to our surprise we had to insert out train ticket back
                                into
                                machine so we can pass the gates. I kept mine but we couldn't find dads. With his
                                confidence
                                he just passed through the info section(which is always
                                next to them)
                                and staff wasn't in place so we didn't have to explain anything. We then bought tickets
                                for
                                next train till our hotel and tried to buy Suica,
                                but again they didn't have one.
                            </p>

                                We finally arrived at our destination and for the first time we stepped on Japan's
                                street.
                                We went to out hotel and I was just flabbergasted.
                                The whole atmosphere of a new country was overflowing in me. I read some signs written
                                in
                                katakana, saw some anime stuff(mostly because we stayed in
                                Akihabara). I already noticed small details like massage place having a poster with high
                                accent on masseuse having quite a big breast,
                                and I don't judge it. I also found a fish store with the name "Allblue"(One Piece fans
                                got
                                me).

                                It was a rainy day, we found our hotel and near the entrace I saw the thing to wrap our
                                umbrella. We asked receptionist to check-in.
                                I could tell that her Englsih was not as profficient as in other countries but
                                it was alright and if anything I could try to explain in Japanese. My dad went to the
                                toilet, our luggage was wet and this lady offered me a towel
                                to dry it. When dad came back he had a smile on his face and said I should check the
                                toilet
                                out. So I did and there was that smart toilet bowl.
                                It had English translations and icons, so I didn't have trouble there. Near reception
                                there
                                were tables with drinks(water, coffe) and shelves with
                                multiple mangas free to read. The lady asked what time we prefer to have a breakfast and
                                gave us breakfast passes and since we checked-in
                                before noon we couldn't go to our room, so we left our luggage and went to explore
                                Japan.

                                I'll have these maps attached to every day, so it can be seen which places we visited.
                                The
                                places are put by order we visited them. Today was supposed
                                to be relaxing day since we had a long flight and needed rest, so I placed things I
                                wanted
                                to visit and didn't expect to have my dad seeing them also.
                                But since there was nothing left to do for him he joined me. At first we went to the
                                shopping mall and it couldn't be compared to anything I've seen
                                before. All floors were divided into categories so it was easier to understand where to
                                look
                                for. There was a huge diversity of items and sometimes we
                                could find those which we didn't know about. Then we visited 3 anime shops looking for
                                something interesting, but I knew I couldn't spend a lot of money
                                during the first day, so we ended up not buying anything.

                                But my dad was already tired of it, so I had to find a restaurant nearby. Luckily there
                                was
                                one right near us which offered the same dish I wanted to try
                                from another restaurant but that one was far away. We entered and it wasn't crowded, we
                                got
                                the menu and there weren't really much offers so we chose
                                standard Tonkatsu and turned out we will cook it ourselves on some rock plate which had
                                a
                                strong candle under it. We got our food, but there were lots of
                                stuff we didn't know about, so we asked passing cook what was it about, and again with
                                poor
                                English but understandable he explained what to do.
                                Most of stuff goes in rice to add flavour and other things help to get different tastes
                                of
                                the whole food. At that time I noticed that I felt shakes and was
                                a bit dizzy, on my comment about it my dad said he didn't feel anything. But that
                                sensation
                                hasn't left me for multiple days, so it could be
                                due to the lack of sleep. The portion was too big for me, and the next thing about Japan
                                is
                                that you pay on the way out near reception instead of
                                leaving money on the table. We left and dad said he needed a nap, it was already time
                                when
                                we could enter our room, so we headed back to hotel,
                                where I left him and continued exploring stores. I bought souvenirs for one friend but
                                couldn't find what I wanted even though I checked all stores in
                                Akihabara. When I already have returned to hotel I searched on the websites and what I
                                was
                                looking for wasn't here. That way our
                                first day passed.

                                In the morning we went down to get a breakfast. We entered cafeteria and another lady
                                instructed us that we have to flip card on our tray if we have
                                finished the meal so staff knows when to take it. Also near the entrance you can take
                                wet
                                wipes to clean your hands(it's pretty common to have that instead
                                of washing hands). There were not as many fruits as one can find in any other country
                                but we
                                still had decent breakfast.
                                We finished eating and as the lady instructed we flipped card and exited. It's time to
                                go
                                sightseeing.

                                The weather forecast said it was going to rain, but in reality it was clear and sunny
                                all
                                day. We first headed towards Tokyo Tower by metro using our metro pass.
                                It was really convenient since you didn't need to pay each time for individual ticket.
                                When
                                we got out of metro we started walking and noticed temple like building,
                                so we went off course and payed more attention to it. Turned out it was a confenece hall
                                and
                                on the way back to track dad stopped to see the car parking,
                                which was 2 stories tall and wanted to know how it works, becaues there were no obvious
                                things which would raise and lower the car.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Finally we approached the tower, and dad insisted on going inside, with the intent to
                                buy
                                entering tickets, even though it was not in my plan. I kept saying
                                we don't have money for that but he just paid with his card. So we went up to
                                observatory.
                                At first, they told us shortly how it was built and why. We got a free
                                picture in middle(vertically) of the tower and finally got up to the highest point.
                                There
                                you can hear from audioguide what things are located where. So it a little helped
                                us to understand our whereabouts. The view was cool, and the city just couldn't end. It
                                was
                                said that you can even see Mt.Fuji but it's a rare occasion. On the way
                                down, we unlike normal people chose to use stairs and for the next 12 minutes regreted
                                this
                                decision. On the bottom there was a souvenier store with a lot of stuff and we
                                could print the photo previously taken in full size for ~10 euro or get a newspaper-like
                                one
                                for free.

                                Our next destination was park nearby and on our way we met a snake, but we didn't spend
                                much
                                time there honestly, so we headed straight to the Zojo-ji temple.
                                We passed through the graveyard and unlike ours it looked really proper and clean, there
                                were multiple brushes and big spoons which you can use
                                in order to clean a grave. Then we entered Zojo-ji and there we first discovered that
                                every
                                pray consists of throwing coins into the special box
                                and witnessed Budha statues. It haven't differed from pictures at all and inside there
                                was
                                an atmospere of a churh. Other buildings weren't as remarkable, so
                                we walked a little and saw a lady selling tickets to enter somewhere. When we asked what
                                was
                                it about she gave us the
                                brochure with some statues on it. We payed around 3 euros and entered the small place
                                surrounded by walls with some statues besides them and four main ones at
                                the end. It wasn't anything special but since we payed not a high sum we weren't upset.
                                And
                                so we started leaving and sat near the gates which are told to be the
                                only structure which survived in here.

                                We then headed towards the Tsukiji market, but stopped near another shopping center
                                since we
                                were asked to buy a golden bow tie for our grandpa.
                                After entering saw that we need to go to 5th floor where male clothes are located. In
                                the
                                elevator I noticed an advertisement about the place which was in my plan
                                but not neccessary to visit, since it was seasonal and I didn't check if it was open
                                during
                                our visit. To my surprise it was right in this building.
                                So after we bought another souvenier and tried to get tax free but unsuccessfully,
                                because
                                we were 400 yen short from minimum, we went to that place -
                                Art Aquarium museum. We payed astonishing 30 euros for 2 tickets and overall I'd say it
                                was
                                not worth it. There were a lot of installations with small fishes, but for my
                                unprofessional eye and not understanding the motives of author it seemed nothing
                                special.
                                Overall, it was an interesting place, but the price was just too
                                high, and I could probably find a better place.

                                After that we finally reached Tsukiji market and by that time wanted to eat, so we
                                entered
                                the first restaurant which looked interesting. There were only locals and overall
                                seemed promising. We ordered the bowls of sashimi with rice and paid at the start
                                because as
                                then really old man explained to other customers it was restaurants
                                policy. We got our food and behind me sat 2 aunties. The old man started serving them
                                and
                                they both were really active and couldn't stop talking to him,
                                if my Japanese was correct they were kind of flirting. The food was good but my dad
                                wanted
                                to still visit the fish auction so he asked me to find out where can
                                we see it from cook. I couldn't really explain that, but after hearing me speaking
                                Japanese,
                                these aunties first waved to me, and then wanted to have
                                a conversation. I somewhat talked with them and they asked where we were from, and so I
                                tried to tell where Latvia is, even showing on map from phone,
                                but the best they could understand was "near Finland". Again, if my Japanese was
                                correct,
                                one of them said Russia wasn't a real country. My dad was proud that I
                                talked to them and we left.

                                Our next stop was supposed to be Japanse Sword Museum, but I checked its working hours
                                and
                                we were already late. So instead we decided to go to Senso-ji since it's
                                open all day. On the way there we visited convenience store and there I found Shonen
                                Jump
                                magazine, it costed only 2 euros, that's why I couldn't resist and bought it.
                                So far we haven't actaully been in a crowd full of tourists, but when we arrived to
                                Senso-ji
                                there were lots of people and great part of them wore kimanos. All buildings
                                were beautiful and it was pleasure to walk there. Among that urban place there were
                                still
                                some nature's areas and it gave a nice overall picture. We
                                headed straight to the temple and suddenly 2 girls approached us in kimonos and asked to
                                take a photo with them, and after photo dad seemed to not have enough
                                of me talking to strangers and said to ask them some questions. They were from Saitama,
                                21
                                years old, and were surprised when I told them my age. I also asked
                                what place they can recommend to visit but they all were already in my list. After that
                                we
                                wandered around and decided to go back.

                                Lying on the bed we needed to book tickets for Tokyo Skytree for tomorrows evening to
                                see
                                the city during the night. But they were sold out. I panicked and
                                then we saw an option of going today at 19:30(it seems they post hourly options in
                                advance,
                                but also sessions in between during the same day when tickets are more
                                expensive). We still got time on our hands so we decided to not let that opportunity
                                slide
                                and bought them. We arrived at place and it was already quite dark.
                                We first went to 300th floor, and that's the place where you should take photos, because
                                on
                                the 450th floor the purple lights get in a way and from that height
                                photos are not so good. The city looked completely different during the night and we
                                could
                                compare the view with previously visited Tokyo Tower, and I think we did right
                                to see Tokyo during the day from smaller tower, and then at night on a higher one. They
                                also
                                had a place where you could take a photo for ~10 euros and they chose a really
                                good angle because behind it was Tokyo Tower which glows red at night and region with
                                high
                                buildings. Overall I really liked it, the tickets costed us 30 euros for both
                                and I would have paid that amount just for myself, so that's a must-have.

                                Our todays first destination was Ueno Park. It was extremely raining. We put on our
                                large
                                raincoats but our feet were still wet. We first were headed to the pond
                                but noticed a tree branch shaped like a circle and decided to check it out. That was
                                Pine of
                                the Moon, and you can view the temple we wanted to visit in first place
                                through that circle. Then we went to that temple and saw a little turtle, that was
                                unexpected. While approaching Ueno Zoo, the rain became more
                                intense, so we found nearest roof where to sit (Gojoten Shrine). Waited around 20
                                minutes
                                and moved closer, but weather had different plans for us so we decided to
                                change our destination to Japanese sword museum.

                                When we exited metro there was no rain in that region, and on the way to museum we
                                noticed 3
                                interesting places which we decided to visit on the way back. We entered
                                museum and on the entrance we got brochure and theory about swords history. I read the
                                whole
                                info and enjoyed looking and analyzing swords and papers on which people
                                tried to transfer swords outline. It was 1 big room with lots of swords(katanas) and
                                books
                                where were a lot of information concerning manufactoring those things. All in
                                all, I liked it, dad - not as much(probably because he hasn't read the brochure).

                                The first place after museum was a random garden and that was outstanding. It was really
                                authentic and the whole contrast of developed city and nature is just
                                something else. There was no detail that irretated me, it was perfect place for
                                relaxation.
                                And it seems that Japan has turtles in place of ducks, because at that
                                garden we've seen them on the sidewalk and some where even sunbathing on stones. This
                                place
                                must be visited if you don't have destination like it in your list.

                                The next one was a church like building, with lots of chairs inside to hear the prayer.
                                Besides us there were only 2 more students on the front rows but they left after short
                                time. Nothing really special but it's okay to spend there a little amount of time to
                                have
                                diversity.

                                Our final destination there before returning to the zoo was The Sumida Hokusai Museum,
                                which
                                contained a great amount of his works, and this is a must-have to visit
                                in order to get a better understanding of Japanese art. We managed to see his paintings
                                and
                                some manga works, some of the stuff is forbidden to take a photo of.
                                But even not being a great fan of art area I still enjoyed it, since it was detailed and
                                pretty.

                                Because of weather becoming better we went back to the zoo. Tickets were extremely cheap
                                comparing to our local one. We headed straight for pandas and there was a big
                                queue and an old man stood at the start of it with a paper which said that we'd spend
                                around
                                20 minutes waiting. After standing there for that time we managed to
                                observe 1 small panda. But when we moved a bit further we saw that there are also big
                                pandas
                                and you have to go around a section and there was no need to wait and
                                the amount of turists was far less. On the way there we also saw read pandas but I
                                couldn't
                                really take a good photo of them. The big panda was also only one and
                                right after we entered it turned away and started eating bamboo leefs so for next at
                                least
                                10 minutes it sat like that and we left. We then checked Small Mammal House and
                                Vivarium, both of them included animals we haven't seen before, so it was a nice
                                experience.
                                One more highlight was gorillas.
                                They had a really big area just for them and ranged from a little baby till an old
                                gorilla
                                father. By that time we were extremely hungry since we haven't eaten anything
                                for multiple hours so instead of seeing other animals we went to Kura sushi restaurant.
                                In
                                it you have to all alone register yourself and then find your table. Luckily, 2
                                girls who were leaving helped us with it. Then you just grab sushi from the conveyor and
                                eat
                                them. All things needed are located inside the table. You open the lid and there
                                would be sauces, chopsticks, and even tea, there is a boiling water tap from which you
                                can
                                fill cup. In case you want something exclusive there is a tablet where you can
                                choose special meals and drinks. After selecting it an order would arrive on second
                                conveyor
                                on top of previous one on high speed, and would stop right at your table. After
                                consuming food, you insert plates in special hole and it drops to the washing sink, that
                                way
                                it calculates how much you own. Every 5 plates would allow you to play a game, but
                                you don't have to do anyting and you just wait, in case you win you get a gacha ball. On
                                the
                                way out you pay near the exit and leave.

                                Today we are heading towards Mt.Fuji - one of the greatest Japan's symbols. We first
                                went to
                                Shinjuku and sat on express train there. Little did we know
                                that it was reservation-only. Luckily conductress either mistook our JR pass for the
                                ticket
                                or saw that we are stupid tourists which just didn't reserve
                                seats for free(because of JR pass). Above the seats were light to understand if specific
                                place is booke but another weird thing was that reserved ones were green,
                                while free - red, also yellow ones meant that person would sit on that place from next
                                station.
                                Anyway, the train was really fast, and views were amazing. We were surrounded by cliffs,
                                covered with trees, private houses and rice fields.
                                We then transfered to another local train and went till Kawaguchiko(there I also asked
                                for
                                train collectable card).

                                Sadly it was raining during that day and the mist covered most of the city. We walked
                                till
                                our place to sleep and to our surprise it was a private house
                                owned by a woman. From the start of our converstion she was extremely active and asked
                                lots
                                of questions. When we mentioned that we were hungry she led
                                us till some local restaurant but it was closed, so she started phoning her other
                                friends
                                and finally someone was still open. She drove us to him and
                                when we ordered our food she left. The restaurant was a gold mine because not only we
                                were
                                out of big city, it wasn't some food chain, and we got a sense of
                                being in family with relatives, so we experienced how Japanese restaurant really looks
                                like.
                                We ate udon and the flavour was really rich.

                                Our next spot was Chureito Pagoda. We walked all the way up there and as expected we
                                couldn't see the Fuji. We saw signs that there are bears and monkeys
                                nearby, so we went a little further but after not being able to see anyone we went back.
                            </p>

                                For the final we had a hot-sping in our plan. It was quite far from where we were, but
                                transport didn't really go directly there so we again just walked.
                                It was a little hard to understand what we needed to do because staff couldn't speak
                                English, but somehow we understood - place your shoes in locker, take
                                towels and move to dressing room(paying again in the end). There were separate rooms for
                                male and female. You have to be fully naked and without tatoos.
                                Before entering any pool you have to wash your full body(it's done while sitting). There
                                were great choices of baths: hot ones, cold, carbonated, jacuzzi
                                and most importantly - hot spring. I liked going into outdoor one and then slowly
                                becoming
                                cooler while resting on the chair. That place also had a sauna
                                and I honestly thought it wouldn't be too hot, but in reality it was up to 100°C. They
                                have
                                towels all over the sitting places but you also have to take a
                                pillow thing to not leave unwanted fluids after yourself. Alltogether I highly recommend
                                this place.

                                While walking till pagoda we wondered why streets were empty and people could be nowhere
                                found. That night the lady answered us that it's happenning due
                                to youngsters leaving the city for bigger opportunities and elder people have to move to
                                nursing homes because they can't look after their big houses by
                                themselves. She when explained us how to prepare our room for sleep, asked when we will
                                have
                                a breakfast and left. We rested for a while and went to sleep.

                                At 4 o'clock my dad woke me up and said to look at the window. The Mt.Fuji was there,
                                completly clear and we were able to witness it's greatness. But our
                                happiness didn't last long since clouds started to block our view or they attached to
                                mountain. However, I still managed to take a photo of it.

                                Today we are going to Kyoto. We headed first to Tokyo, because there are no other great
                                options of going there from Kawaguchiko. We learned by our mistakes and
                                reserved the seats for express train. We then "bought" tickets for the Shinkansen by
                                finding
                                special place and asking worker to create us tickets. For the next
                                4 hours we were just travelling across Japan with 300+km/h speed.
                                When we were passing Fuji people crowded near the windows but it couldn't be seen,
                                that's
                                why I was proud we had gone near it before.

                                When our train arrived we went to our new hotel but on the way there one of luggage's
                                wheels
                                got torn apart, so it was troublesome for us to move for the
                                rest of the tour. Our hotel also had shelves with manga but also a laundry room, small
                                pool
                                with hot water, public shower and sauna.

                                After we checked-in and left our belongings in the room we went to eat some karaage.
                                Then I
                                went to the cinema to watch "Black clover" movie while dad
                                went to the fishing store. As I was going there I analyzed the city and it was really
                                different from Tokyo and life seemed calmer. The movie theater itself was located
                                in street with lots of stores and restaurants, so I kept that in mind for future
                                sight-seeing. I was overhyped that's why the film wasn't so good for me, on the way back
                                it was dark and night city looked great. I also found anime store with manga and anime
                                merch. On the forth floor there was an adult section while on the one below a whole
                                sex shop. I've never been to one and I knew that in Japan it was even more interesting.
                                There were all sorts of things and some of them were anime themed. For example, there
                                was an artifitial female genitalia which was supposed to be a representation of one
                                made-up
                                character. After quickly cheking that out I went back. That was it for this day.

                                Today we started with the famous golden temple - Kinkaku-ji. In Kyoto we were using
                                buses
                                because metro wasn't as advanced as in Tokyo. Near the entrance
                                there was a bell and just for 200 yen you can hit it and get a postcard. The sound was
                                pretty loud and beautiful. We then went till the temple and it was
                                pretty nice esspecially for the price for entrence, what we understood was that these
                                places
                                weren't only about the temple, you are able to witness the whole
                                area around it and workers go around cleaning it really often for it to look majestic.

                            <p>
                                Close to Kinkaku-ji was Ryoan-ji, so we walked there but nothing really special was
                                there,
                                it was okay and we wandered around looking at how things looked in
                                the past. We saw there the popular stone garden and headed to exit.
                            </p>
                            <div class="img">

                            <p>
                                We then went back to main train station because our next stops were near it. The first
                                was
                                the train museum. It was okay, I can just recommend
                                it to visit either if you have kids or you are highly interested in this topic. They had
                                lots of activities and exhibitions so it made the process of better
                                understanding that area more exciting unlike others extremely boring museums.

                                We then went to eat. After eating at Kura sushi again we visited Kyoto aquarium. We saw
                                a
                                great diversity of water animals and were pretty
                                satisfied by this place. There was a great aquarium full with fishes, sharks and slopes.
                                You
                                could look at it for hours and not get bored. That was the place
                                where most couples sat. They had a full room of jellyfished and how they get grown. From
                                one
                                hand it was interesting and beautiful, but from another I don't
                                really like them. On top of the building you can see a dolphin show but we weren't at
                                the
                                right time, so plan it before you go there. Overall, it was a fair
                                price of 30 euros for 2 people to watch all this.

                                Our first destination for today was Nijo Castle. We got a chance to walk inside and we
                                didn't know that there were nightingale floors so our first thoughts were
                                that they were just purely designed. We watched rooms where the shogun was meant to
                                meet,
                                get presents and talk with guests. The whole rooms were pretty much empty
                                which seems weird to foreigner eyes, but such little details as shogun having a higher
                                place
                                in the room to show his status are just fascinating. The area was
                                really big and contained other buildings and it looked pretty protected as it should
                                have
                                been.

                                We next intended to visit Yasaka shrine but something went wrond and we went to Chion-in
                                temple, where we we supposed to then go further till shrine, but I forgot
                                about it and we just left it thinking we did what we wanted. But that place was also
                                good,
                                in the main buildings there were budhist praying so people could hear
                                them from the outside. There also were multiple buildings we haven't seen before which
                                are
                                somehow used for praying. And since it was pretty high from the ground
                                you can get a nice view from concrete places.

                                Further we went to Kodai-ji which was more or else like everything before, but it
                                contained
                                more greenness and nature. From there we also saw a big statue of Budha
                                and after exploring this location we moved to it.

                                This place had a big statue, his footprints encraved in stone, and inside Budha were
                                different statues of gods for each zodiac sign. Again, nothing really special
                                but it's okay to see it.

                                Then we visited the most crowded street with old fashioned houses. At that point we were
                                hungry but there were either stores with candies or really expensive
                                restaurants, so we decided to move further but for all that time my dad was jelous of me
                                having a photo with Japanese girls so we noticed other 2 ladies taking
                                photos of themselves and after they finished we asked to be in photo with him. And so we
                                went further.

                                Our final temple for today was Kiyomizu-dera. It is huge, we finally understood where
                                all
                                the tourists were. But unlike other places it was basically a
                                single building there so it's great to look at it from the side, but at the bottom of it
                                there also is a fountain from which you are supposed to drink from 1 of 3
                                streams. I didn't remember which represented which so I drunk from the same as dad and
                                hoped
                                for the best, but line for it was for sure long.

                                Not being able to eat for so long we were starving but couldn't really find a fancy
                                restaurant, so when we again visited fishing store to finally purchase the thing
                                for our friend I found ramen shop nearby and we ate there. Ramen was really great and
                                spicy,
                                and as udon it contained rich flavour. After that we returned to hotel
                                and I decided to take a walk in Kyoto by myself enjoying sunset and peaceful
                                surroundings.

                                Today's day was supposed to be chill and inexpensive, but turned out as it always does.
                                We
                                went to forest areas of Arashiyama parks. And the first place was
                                Tenryu-ji. Comparing to previous temples it was a bit boring, but for starters it was
                                alright.
                            </p>
                            <div class="img">

                                While going through the bamboo forest We then noticed some private park and payed the
                                admission to enter there. We got included a cup of matcha and some hard chulk-like
                                sweet thing. The whole route was pretty big and we explored lots of places. All of them
                                were
                                really clean so even moss looked pretty. There also were view points, first
                                on a small temple fully surrounded by forest and another on Kyoto. There also was a
                                house
                                were you can write anything you want and read what others left there. We really
                                liked that place and it's definetly worth seeing.

                                We haven't really explored the Arashiyama park itself since we haven't noticed something
                                particulary interesting and went straight for the river and stayed there for a
                                while just watching. There were some people on boats where the oar was just a long stick
                                that was used to push off the ground.
                            </p>

                                Then comes the most exciting part of today - the monkey park. You have to pay at the
                                start
                                and then climb all the way till the hill's end. On the way there there were
                                2 coolings fans which sprayed you with water, that was the most genious and luxurous
                                thing I
                                had during that day. At some points you could have a quiz about monkeys to
                                better know them and near the end you hear the instructions what to do and what not to
                                do.
                                Finally, we made it there, and there for sure were lots of monkeys. They were
                                everywhere, and that's just so interesting to look at how they behave right in front of
                                you.
                                There was also a room where you could feed them but we decided not to. From
                                there you could also see the whole Kyoto, so we stayed there for quite a time.

                                When we got bored and left we basically completed our todays plan, but since it was only
                                noon I added our next stop - owl's cafe. On the way there dad insisted on
                                going in expensive crab restaurant which was at the very end of the store district.
                                After
                                all my attemps to say that we can't spend that much money dad just went inside.
                                We ordered our food, dad - raw legs, I - rice with crab. Dad got his order almost right
                                away, while I was waiting 40 minutes untill rice on our table was prepared. This
                                restaurant was really fancy, you could call waitress by phone and they every now and
                                then
                                replaced our tea. I didn't really enjoy the dish because I am not a fan of it.

                                After that we as wanted visited owl's cafe and the experience couldn't be predicted. I
                                was
                                fascinated and dad seemed to enjoy too. You get your hands santisized and then
                                you can pet all owls expect those which card shows that they are new or on a break. They
                                were a little scary but the feathers on them were really light and pleasent to
                                touch. On the way out dad said that that's seems fishy because they didn't even try to
                                fly
                                out(they had their feet handcuffed to branches), so they might have mixed something
                                in their food to make them unable to do it, I just shook it off and tried to remember
                                only
                                good stuff.

                                Just when we were already on the train home my dad said that he wanted to visit Fushimi
                                Inari Taisha. I said that I didn't have that in plan because due to my reasearch I know
                                that this place is overrated and there is absolutely nothing to see. Again, he insisted
                                on
                                going there so we did. It was plain red gates and most of them were in not the best
                                condition, there were lots of people as well, so it's pretty hard to get a nice photo of
                                one
                                standing there. After climbing for 30 minutes I stopped at some checkpoint and
                                waited for my dad to return. There you also could see the Kyoto and since it was evening
                                it
                                looked really nice. After around 20 minutes dad finally returned and just as I
                                expected he said that there was nothing special there. So we returned home and I went to
                                sauna to relax, but it was too hot for me, so after 10 minutes I was going back to room.

                                Today we are goind to Kobe - the port and city made in European style, it is also famous
                                for
                                wagyuu beef and sake. So the first place we went to was sake museum. It was completly
                                for free and every step of making this product was clearly explained with videos and wax
                                figures representing workers. They even had a conference hall where you could see full
                                history of manufactoring at that company. In the end were souveniers and you can taste 3
                                types of sake also for free. After degustation we decided to buy overall 4 sakes - 3
                                classic
                                and 1 made from oranges. We then had to carry them for all day.

                                For next destination I chose earthquake museum. It was a big building and to our
                                surprise
                                there worked solely elderly volunteers. They were really excited to see some guests and
                                after a while we notices that this place wasn't really popular. Because of it we got a
                                special treatment and they showed us all the stuff and asked lots of questions about us.
                                This
                                place was very educating and was full of interactive things to understand things better.
                                We
                                went to the restaurant in the same building and ate spicy yet delicious curry with rice.

                                Dad really wanted to swim at Atlantic ocean so he kept asking me to lead him till it. I
                                agreed but on condition that it'd be fast because our next destination closed soon. He
                                was
                                really
                                happy and he achieved his goal there. He said the water was perfect, not cold at all but
                                not
                                too hot. Strangely no one else was willing to swim there.

                                And so we rushed to Nunobiki gardens and we were able to jump in the last cabin. Sadly
                                we
                                paid 30 euros and were not able to go back by foot and we had only 30 minutes there so I
                                got
                                a little upset and frustrated. In the garden located house where you could smell lots of
                                odor types in jars and then purchase parfume on the way back by taking a piece of paper
                                of
                                smell you
                                liked. The view was also good but I liked more the dam which could be seen only from
                                cabin.
                                There also could be seen the waterfall which was our final destination for today.

                            <p>
                                So after getting back we went straight for the Nunobiki waterfall. The route was longer
                                than
                                we expected and by the time we got there we were already exhausted. The watefall was
                                really
                                satisfying. I could stare at it for a long time but we had to go. We went down the
                                stream
                                and at some places there were also waterfalls and the sound of running water was
                                relaxing.

                                This day we are coming back to Tokyo. On the way there we stopped at Nagoya in order to
                                visit Toyota museum. It was also for free and dad really wanted to visit it. When we
                                arrived
                                there
                                also were no people. The lady said that we wouldn't be able to see the factory so we got
                                really upset because that was mainly the reason we went there. Anyway, we studied how
                                different
                                things work there, tested new brakes system, saw mechanic arm, how paint is applied, new
                                models etc.

                                We got back to station and went till Shinagawa and from there till Shibuya. We already
                                noticed that there was extreme amount of people. Trains were full, when we got off it
                                metro
                                was also
                                filled and so were streets. On the way out of metro we saw Shibuya crossing and Hachiko
                                memorial straight away. We got to our hotel, left our luggage and started again visiting
                                anime stores
                                to finally buy me souvenier. Sadly, none of the stores had One piece merch left. So I
                                found
                                store nearby with One piece only thematic.

                                After that we finally went to eat, by that time it was already late evening. And that
                                was
                                Wagyuu beef restaurant. All things costed a lot so we ordered assorti of 6
                                different kinds of beef 3 slices each for 60 euros. They were out of this world. Nothing
                                compared to it from my past experience. We cooked them by ourselves
                                so I might overcooked it so it may taste even better if done by professionals.

                                It was supposed to be the end for today but again, dad insisted on visiting the New York
                                Bar
                                which shined in film Lost in Translation. First of all, it was in Shinjuku, second - the
                                entrence fee
                                costed ~25 euros for 2 of us. I said we spent all our budget but dad just kept going. We
                                entered the building and the route to this bar looks like it: at start you enter 1
                                elevator
                                which takes
                                you to 40th floor, and then change to another one which brings you to the last floor
                                where
                                the bar is located. We got off from the first elevator and it looked like it was another
                                bar
                                or cafe.
                                But it was already closed and only 1 lady stood there finishing some stuff on her
                                register.
                                Instead of walls there were big windows and they were covered with curtains. But no one
                                keeps you out from
                                having a little peek there so I took some really great photos of night Tokyo. In my
                                opinion,
                                they are even better than from Tokyo Skytree because we were closer to the ground and
                                you
                                get better
                                quality of buildings and streets. I said that there is no need to go to the bar now but
                                dad
                                said that we'll just see how it looks there and go back. We got there and dad asked
                                receptionist some
                                questions and said that we'll think about it, and at that moment she asked us if we had
                                spare clothes, we were confused, so she explained that they don't allow people in
                                shorts, so
                                my luck was
                                better than ever. We went back to hotel and our day ended.

                                Today we are going back home. We went to the airport. There we saw a huge line for our
                                flight near check-in. We stood there and then saw a machine from which some of the
                                tourists
                                got some tickets. We
                                thought that by getting tickets from there we might pass this line. I went and got our
                                boarding tickets there. Dad said that others also get a sticker for luggage from there.
                                He
                                went and got it.
                                I took our luggage and moved to another terminal where they accepted it. I gave them our
                                tickets but they strictly directed me back to our line. Turned out even if we do this it
                                doesn't really
                                matter because lady there would make them for you, so it should be quicker if you do it
                                but
                                in reality they talked while working and that's why line wasn't really moving. After we
                                finally passed
                                it we went to but souveniers and spend our last money from the budget. Interestingly,
                                stores
                                accepted Suica cards even if there were not enough money so we drained them till 0 on
                                our
                                accounts and added
                                neccessary amount for purchase, that way you don't have to worry about leaving some
                                money on
                                that card. Then we waited for our airplane and went again to Denmark and after waiting
                                for
                                hour and a half sat
                                on the flight back to Latvia. And that is how this story ends.
