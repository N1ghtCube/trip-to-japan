            <h3>Criteria</h3>
            <p>For all our hotels we had the same criteria, wchich looked like this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rating 8+</li>
                <li>Under 100 euros per night</li>
                <li>Includes breakfast</li>
                <li>2 separeate beds</li>
                <li>Free canceling</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We then chose from the available hotels on the website(we used <a href="https://www.booking.com/">booking.com</a>) based on location and reviews. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="hotels" id="akihabara">
            <h3>Akihabara</h3>
            <p>
                For staying in Tokyo we decided to go with <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/jp/best-western-hotel-fino-tokyo.en-gb.html">Best Western Hotel 
                Fino Tokyo Akihabara</a>, since it was the only decent option for the time we were there, and luckily it was all good. Personal was really polite, 
                and everything was super clean. We faced no problems there and left with sadness that there is no coming back. Breakfasts were nutritious and tasty. 
                They also had free coffee and water dispenser as well as manga shelf where you could borrow anything to read and return. All in all, really great hotel.
            </p>

            <h3>Kawaguchiko</h3>
            <p>
                We then stopped at as it tourned out in a private house, <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/jp/link-house.en-gb.html">LINK HOUSE</a>. The owner was 
                a middle age woman who was extremely active and helped us with some stuff. We were given a room with a view on Mt.Fuji and in the morning we got a breakfast 
                made by her. We slept on tatami, however, during the night we constantly heared frogs which highly irretated me, but overall it was OK.

        <div class="hotels" id="kyoto">
            <h3>Kyoto</h3>
            <p>
                In Kyoto there was a huge amount of hotels which met our criteria and because of that we decided to add necessity of having a pool. That is why our next 
                place, <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/jp/hotel-kuretakeso-kyoto-kiyomizu-gojyo.en-gb.html">Kyonoyado Kiyomizu Gojo Kuretakeso</a>, had bath with 
                sauna and a little pool. It also had manga shelf as the first hotel did and washing machines. The last one was a huge plus since at this 
                time most of our clothes were dirty. In order to get in those rooms we had to ask at registration for a pass. There we would have to pay with coins for 
                machines to work. Breakfast had more diversity and nutritious food. We also were given pyjamas which we could use in the morning. Even though this hotel 
                was near the highway there was no noise during the night.
            </p>

            <h3>Shibuya</h3>
            <p>
                Coming back to Tokyo we again faced the problem of having not many options so we decided to spend a little over the budget and went with 
                <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/jp/shibuya-tobu.en-gb.html">Shibuya Tobu Hotel</a>. It for sure looked more prestige than others. However, our room 
                was quite smelly due to cigarettes, even though we ordered non-smoker one. For breakfast there were only 2 options so we had to eat what they offered. 
                Alltogether, I would think of finding a better option instead of this one.
